# Episode 5 : Credential Store
In this episode you learn how to utilise the environment variables that IBM Cloud makes available to read in the service
credentials. If the credentials are not found in IBM Cloud, ie. when you have not bound them into your application, the 
application checks for the credentials in a credentials.json file. Which you can then protect appropriately.
