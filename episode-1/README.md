# Episode 1 : Application Shell and Language Identification
This episode shows how to create initial Django and Flask projects with an application shell that can
be run both outside and on IBM Cloud. The Watson Developer Cloud SDK for Python is used to incorporate simple
language identification into the application. As the application is developed, accidental typos have been
generated, but have deliberately kept in to show the debugging and problem analysis process.

The code that has been submitted to this repository, has passed tests performed at the end of the episode.
